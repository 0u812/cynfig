- Changed order if includes in synfigstudio so that ETL/stringf is included before anything
has a chance to define HAVE_UNISTD_H (HAVE_UNISTD_H messes up _stringf.h on MSVC for 
obvious reasons)

- cellrenderer_value.cpp: changed sigc::mem_fun to sigc::mem_fun2 to explicitly specify two
parameters for member function type

- had to add intl.lib (in gtkmm) to list of libs to avoid unresolved external symbol _libintl_printf
(went from 168 errors to 11, 8 unresolved externals) (C:\Users\user\Documents\develop\sfdeps\gtkmm\lib\intl.lib)

- added C:\Users\user\Documents\develop\sfdeps\zlib\lib\zdll.lib to input libs. Got it down to 2 unresolved externals.

- Boost note: on Windows, "only ordinary static libraries use the lib prefix; import libraries and DLLs do not" (http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_48_0/more/getting_started/windows.html)

- On Windows, in order to avoid getting duplicate symbol errors caused by linking in Boost static libs (despite
the fact multiple fucking options telling it not to use the static libs such as Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS are specified), one
must not only set set(BOOST_ALL_DYN_LINK ON) in CMakeLists.txt but also add_definitions(-DBOOST_ALL_DYN_LINK)
